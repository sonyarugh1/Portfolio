 <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Throughout this computer science course I’ve been able to expand my understanding of a number of computer science concepts. I have chosen to display this new found understanding through this website, which I have created using html, css, and js. It contains a breakdown of a number of important aspects in this course as well as some of my personal opinions on different assignments and modules </p>
<h2>Top 10 list</h2>
<p>I’ve composed a list of the top 10 modules I’ve studied in this course, not only to display what I have worked on in this course, but also to demonstrate my own understanding and opinion on each module. </p>

  Hackathon
I found the hackathon module the most useful as I had to do a lot of research, and ask a lot of questions in order to achieve the end product. This was the largest program I had worked on in JS so far, so it allowed me to develop the skills necessary to create larger and more complex programs. I was able to discuss concepts with my partner which made it easier to determine what was achievable given the timeline and we were able to execute it together. This not only taught me about programming and computer science but also teamwork and communication. I have already used a large amount of what I learned in this module throughout the rest of the course, but moving forward I think knowing how to insert images in HTML and hide them in certain JS files will be very useful as well as knowing how to use scenes. One thing I do wish I had the time to learn while coding this game was animation of objects in JS, specifically animating the coin into the piggy bank.

Coding challenge
Similarly to the hackathon I found the coding challenge extremely useful, and it is only ranked lower as I already had the hackathon as prior knowledge and therefore did not learn as many new concepts. Having said that, this challenge gave me the opportunity to apply all of the concepts I learned in the hackathon which further reinforced them, as well as learn a number of new concepts through research, questions, and working through the base code. This challenge required a lot more problem solving than the hackathon and I faced a number of obstacles, but in turn I learned a lot and I now know how to work with buttons and create effects in different scenes. Although I haven't had as much time to apply this new found knowledge, I plan on using it anytime I am working with buttons and/or if statements. This knowledge will help me tremendously as I move forward as a student, because I will not have to do as much research and I can avoid certain crashes that I ran into during this project. This will allow me to redirect my time and attention to learn new concepts and ensure that the skills I already have are optimized.

Learn HTML 
I found the learn HTML module on codecademy very useful as it provided me with a strong base in HTML. I learned how to create a webpage using headers, titles and images, and I got more insight on how webpages are made. I used this base knowledge  to create a large part of the webpage that this information is being displayed on and I will continue to apply this knowledge throughout any project where I am using HTML, particularly websites as that was what this module focused on. This will be very useful in the future if I am ever trying to start my own business or if I am trying to display myself to potential employers. 

Learn p5.js 
The learning p5.js module on code academy was very useful as it gave me a proper introduction to p5.js which was a web editor I used frequently in the course. This base knowledge made me feel a lot more comfortable when coding because I already knew about the web editor and all of this feature. I will without a doubt use this knowledge in my future as a student because I will have a web editor that I feel very comfortable with and will be able to  use under most circumstances. I also know that this editor is not the best for collaborative projects, so I can also avoid it when working with others, which will save time. 

Intro to JS 
I found the intro to JS module on khan academy useful as I was able to learn new concepts regarding JS, and I was able to apply this knowledge through small challenges and quizzes. Although the concepts were not very complex it was very helpful for me at the time as JavaScript was a completely new language to me and I had no prior knowledge of it which would have made it difficult to jump into some of the other concepts, but after I obtained this base it was much easier to grasp more difficult concepts. As most of these concepts were quite simple and regularly used I anticipate that I will use what I learned in this module anytime that I code in JS. This will allow me to have a strong base for my code and to have less bugs as I am more confident in my abilities. 

Data analysis + simulations + online data security 
I found this module quite interesting and it resonated with me quite a bit. The data analysis and simulations resonated with me more on the programming side whereas the online data security resonated with me more emotionally. I had already done a large research project on data analysis and simulations so I did not learn as much in this part of the module as I have others, but I still enjoyed it as it is something I am very interested in, and I am considering pursuing a career in this field.  The data security aspect of this module resonated with me emotionally as it puts into perspective the amount of information that is available about you on the internet, and the lack of real privacy that you have. I will use this information moving forward not only as a student but also in my everyday life to ensure that my data is as safe as it can be, and I will know what extra measures to take to make sure that I am as secure as possible.

Computer Innovation + Internet 
I found this module to be very interesting as I learned about the internet and its different levels of accessibility across the globe as well as how the computers we know now came to be. I find this very interesting as it allows us to fully appreciate the technology that we have available to us and the opportunities that this technology brings that may not be available to others for a variety of reasons. I will use this knowledge as a student to take advantage of these technologies and attempt to maximize my potential and efficiency with these tools.

Digital Information + Algorithms
I found this module very interesting as it provides us with the logic behind everyday things that we may not think too much about such as music or photos. This aspect of the module was fun to think about as it gives you a deeper understanding of everything around you. I also found the algorithm aspect to be interesting as it is like a set of rules that is followed over and over to achieve a certain goal. These both help me to grow as a student as they expand my general knowledge of computers and data as well as the way the computer processes information. It also allows me to solve certain puzzles such as the rubik's cube by using an algorithm or a set of rules. 

Natural Simulations 
The natural simulations module was very helpful for my development as it allowed me to practice what I learnt throughout the khan academy course with a variety of projects that pushed me at the time. These projects were small and simple enough that I could complete them with my prior knowledge, but also complex enough that they began to prepare me for larger projects like the hackathon and coding challenge. I think this was a very important middle ground for me as it connected the smaller challenges and the complex programs so the gap between them was smaller. I will continue to use what I learned in this module when coding similar projects or larger programs. 

AP computer science to 100%
The general computer programming module of khan academy was useful as it provided me with a good background information for everything I mentioned above which is important as the more complex concepts cannot not be applied without a good base. I will say that this type of learning does not suit me as well as guided lessons from a teacher, or larger programs, but it was still useful nonetheless. I will continue to use and apply this knowledge not only when coding in JS but also when coding in other languages because a lot of this information is useful for any programming.
